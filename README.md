# Question Answering System

Question answering is a critical NLP problem and a long-standing artificial intelligence milestone. QA systems allow a user to express a question in natural language and get an immediate and brief response. It is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing, which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Structure of Question Answering System
The design of a question answering system has specific vital components. There are three distinct modules used in a question-answering system:

* *Query Processing Module*: Classifies questions according to the context. This module identifies the context and focus, classifies the type of question, and sets the answer typeâ€™s expectations.
* *Document Processing Module*: Information retrieval module that focuses on gathering relevant documents.
* *Answer Processing Module*: Once the relevant documents are retrieved, they need to be parsed through to obtain an accurate and appropriate answer.

## :dart: Objective
Our objective is to develop a Question Answering System using Seq2Seq approach.

## :pencil2: Dataset
We use the SQuAD dataset for training and validating our model.

## :pencil2: Overview of the Model
* Trained the model on a Seq2Seq model using the LSTM Neural Network.
* Trained on 1500 epochs
